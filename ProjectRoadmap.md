# Project Roadmap 
## First Phase
    - [x] Schedule presentation in teams
    - [x] Write inital project files (README, ProjectRoadmap)
    - [x] Research similar repositories to gain a better understanding of what I'm trying to do 
    After reading the repository by Gerado5797, I notice that he does his currency covnersion in python differently than the Youtube video that I watched, doing the "testvalidcurrency" command instead of simply using "print(USD currency rates at EUR)" , specifically to avoid using API calls. I may also look into using commands to avoid using API calls
    - [x] Find existing sample code and test it 
    - [x] Come up with a definitive name for the application (GlobeChange)
## Second Phase
    - [x] Develop the core currency convertor
    - [x] Develop the GUI to be clean, nice to look at, and user friendly


## Final Phase
    - [ ] Integrate historical integration and news article titles and links
    - [ ] Test code and update README file to explain how the application works
    - [ ] Make any final changes and make sure the code is free of any syntax errors
    - [x] Create the powerpoint splash
